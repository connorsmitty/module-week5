# module-week5

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a daily checklist that would be responsive to the past, present and future times of the day and which taskes were allotted to them by category.

Overall I have struggled greatly with this assignment and am facing many roadblocks in order to get the functions to operate properly why still implying the same creative theme that was given to us.

The first three hours that are displayed arent cohesive with the other hours that are listed for the day and I can not manage how to fix the display properly yet. 

Also when I get the hours to display a color, the command that I would like to give them doesnt properly save on the page refresh. 

I will simply be changing and modifyig the code in the next following weeks to make sure that everything operates properly.
